# Network_Packet_Encoder
An application that stimulates a network scenario for 1 source and 'n' sinks and generates best set of packet combinations to achieve minimum number of transmissions. I developed this application in order to demonstrate advantage of encoded transmission over un-encoded transmission for my project work in CS6150  Advanced Algorithms course at the University of Utah Fall 2018.
